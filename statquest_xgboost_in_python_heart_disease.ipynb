    "# Import the modules that will do all the work\n",
    "The very first thing we do is load in a bunch of python modules. Python, itself, just gives us a basic programming language. These modules give us extra functionality to import the data, clean it up and format it, and then build, evaluate and draw the **XGBoost** model. \n",

    "- sklearn >= 0.24.1\n",
    "- xgboost >= 1.3.3\n",
    " \n",
    "If you installed **Python 3** with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), you can check which versions you have with the command: `conda list`. If, for example, your version of `scikit-learn` is older than 0.22.1, then the easiest thing to do is just update all of your **Anaconda** packages with the following command: `conda update --all`. However, if you only want to update `scikit-learn`, then you can run this command: `conda install scikit-learn=0.22.1`.\n",

All of the other columns, however, need to be inspected to make sure they only contain reasonable values, and some of them need to change. This is because, while **XGBoost** natively supports continuous data, like resting blood pressure (**restbp**) and maximum heart rate (**thalach**), it does not natively support categorical data, like chest pain (**cp**), which contains 4 different categories.

    "If we treated these values, 1, 2, 3 and 4, like continuous data, then we would assume that 4, which means \"asymptomatic\", is more similar to 3, which means \"non-anginal pain\", than it is to 1 or 2, which are other types of chest pain. That means the **XGBoost Tree** would be more likely to cluster the patients with 4s and 3s together than the patients with 4s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat each one a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering patients with 4s with 3s is the same as clustering 4s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable.\n",

    "**NOTE:** There are many different ways to do **One-Hot Encoding** in Python. Two of the more popular methods are `ColumnTransformer()` (from **scikit-learn**) and `get_dummies()` (from **pandas**), and both methods have pros and cons. `ColumnTransformer()` has a very cool feature where it creates a persistent function that can validate data that you get in the future. For example, if you build your **XGBoost** model using a categorical variable **favorite color** that has **red**, **blue** and **green** options, then `ColumnTransformer()` can remember those options and later on when your **XGBoost** model is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is **orange**, then `ColumnTransformer()` can throw an error or handle the situation in some other nice way. The downside of `ColumnTransformer()` is that it turns your data into an array and loses all of the column names, making it harder to verify that your usage of `ColumnTransformer()` worked as you intended it to. In contrast, `get_dummies()` leaves your data in a dataframe and retains the column names, making it much easier to verify that it worked as intended. However, it does not have the persistent behavior that `ColumnTransformer()` has. So, for the sake of learning how **One-Hot Encoding** works, I prefer to use `get_dummies()`. However, once you are comfortable with **One-Hot Encoding**, I encourage you to investigate using `ColumnTransformer()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, before we commit to converting **cp** with **One-Hot Encoding**, let's just see what happens when we convert **cp** without saving the results. This will make it easy to see how `get_dummies()` works."
